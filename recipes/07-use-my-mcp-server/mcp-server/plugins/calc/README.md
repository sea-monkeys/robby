**Addition (+)** - Combining two or more numbers to find their sum. For example, 5 + 3 = 8.

**Subtraction (-)** - Finding the difference between two numbers by taking one away from another. For example, 8 - 3 = 5.

**Multiplication (×)** - Repeated addition of a number. It finds the product when one number is added to itself a specified number of times. For example, 4 × 3 = 12 (which is the same as 4 + 4 + 4).

**Division (÷)** - Splitting a number into equal parts or finding how many times one number goes into another. For example, 12 ÷ 3 = 4.

These four operations form the foundation of arithmetic and are essential functions in any basic calculator or computing device. More advanced calculation machines can perform additional operations like exponentiation, square roots, trigonometric functions, and logarithms, but these four remain the core mathematical operations.
